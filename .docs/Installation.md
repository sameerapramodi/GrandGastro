# Installation
You can install PureFrame in two ways: by manually downloading the source code or by using Composer, a popular PHP package manager. Both installation methods are officially supported by the framework.

### Composer Installation
The parent folder of your project root directory is where you can find the folder that is one level above your project.

```

> composer create-project pureframe/pureframe

```
